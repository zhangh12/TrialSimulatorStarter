# Shiny App for `TrialSimulator` <img src="logo.png" align="right" width="175" />

**&#x2695; No more `for` loop in clinical trial simulation &#x2695;**

This Shiny app enables users of the R package `TrialSimulator` to generate R codes for simulation by specifying simulation settings from UI. 

This app is still under development and is not ready for use. 

This app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://bx7ttm-han-zhang.shinyapps.io/trialsimulatorstarter/). 

To launch this app on your computer, clone this repo and execute
``` r
runApp()
```
in the folder containing `app.R`. 

## Installation

To execute the R generated by the app, you can install the development version of `TrialSimulator` from [GitHub](https://github.com/zhangh12/TrialSimulator) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(
  "zhangh12/TrialSimulator", 
  build_manual = TRUE,
